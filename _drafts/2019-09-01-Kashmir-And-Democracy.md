summary: Kashmir has been denied democracy since throughout this century. The authoratarianism came in full view on August 5, when Indian government decided to strip away the on-paper autonomy of Kashmir. When I talked to my friends about Kashmir and the abuse of democratic principles, I was challenged to defend democractic principles themselves. In this article, I defend democratic principles and their application to the Kashmir issue.
