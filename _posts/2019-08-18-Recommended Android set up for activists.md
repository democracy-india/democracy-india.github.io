# Securing your phone

Enhancing your privacy is a never ending journey. It is like fixing a
leaking vessel, only one hole is enough to leak all your data. Here is a
compilation of commonly found holes and how to fix them. If you can
afford it, do not use smart-phones at all. However, there is always a
trade-off between convenience and privacy. This document is supposed to
be a running document of what works for a typical android user without
compromising too much convenience or privacy.

Protect your browsing and location history 
-----------------------------------------------

Go to
[https](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[://](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[myaccount](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[.](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[google](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[.](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[com](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[/](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)[privacycheckup](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup)
and disable or pause all history tracking, especially
[location](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/activitycontrols)[](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/activitycontrols)[tracking](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/activitycontrols).

Google and your ISP (like Airtel, Jio, Idea etc) still knows your
location even if it promises to forget it.

### Use Firefox focus 

[Download Firefox focus here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus)

It won’t save history. Your ISP (like Airtel, Jio, Idea etc) still knows
which websites you are visiting.

Using Firefox focus can become annoying because you will have to sign-in
again to the websites every time you open it. If you are using twitter,
facebook from Firefox, this can be annoying. The solution is to use
Firefox focus for everything except the websites you sign-in to.

For signing-in to the websites, like Facebook, Twitter etc. you can use normal Firefox.

### Do not use Google Chrome 

It will ask you to login to your google account then send everything to
Google[\[1\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/?noredirect=on).
Use firefox instead.

[Install firefox from play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)

If you want to use Chrome do not sign in.

Protect your contacts 
--------------------------

Almost every app wants to know your contacts. Your contacts are
sensitive information. Government agencies are known to assume guilt by
association
[\[2\]](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/bhima-koregaon-activist-sudha-bharadwaj-under-house-arrest-till-august-30/315700).
Even if you are eventually proved innocent, it can lead to avoidable
harassment of you or your contacts. Either do not not enter your
sensitive/political contacts in the Android contacts list or do not
allow any app to access them. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
WhatsApp, etc want to access them

Uninstall Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Use them from inside Firefox.

### Google knows your contacts

Since Google knows your contacts, do not add sensitive people’s numbers
to your contact list.

Or follow steps to disable contact sync:

If you have already added the contacts, you will have to go to
[contacts](https://contacts.google.com/)[.](https://contacts.google.com/)[google](https://contacts.google.com/)[.](https://contacts.google.com/)[com](https://contacts.google.com/)
and then delete the contacts individually.

### WhatsApp knows your contacts

Since WhatsApp knows your contacts, do not add sensitive people’s
numbers to your contact list.

Or follow steps to disable contact sync:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EtAxXOeUB44" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Protect your conversations 
-------------------------------

### Use Signal or Telegram instead of WhatsApp

Ask all of your friends to move to Signal (or Telegram). If they do,
uninstall WhatsApp. If they don’t, use Signal (or Telegram) for sensitive and
political conversations. 

The benefit of Telegram over Signal is that it allows you to hide your phone
number and groups of size up to 50,000. Latest Hong Kong protester’s preferred
social media is Telegram and LIHKG (equivalent of [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/))
[\[4\]](https://hear-here.blog/hong-kong-a-crowd-sourced-revolt/)

The benefit of Signal over Telegram is that Signal does not remember who you are
talking to and hence cannot hand over that information to the government even if
they have a legal warrant.

Download Signal from
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms).

Download Telegram from
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger).

### Use disappearing messages on Signal/Telegram 

“Disappearing messages” delete themselves after a certain time window.
Enable them by default for your political conversations. Disable for
specific messages that you want to save.

To manage disappearing messages on Signal follow steps [here](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320771-Set-and-manage-disappearing-messages#android_disappearing).

### Be ready to wipe your sensitive apps and data with a single click 

[Install Ripple](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.ripple)

Follow the following steps to setup Ripple:

Advanced: If you want other apps to uninstall so that their data gets
wiped out too, you will have to install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/fr/2019/06/15/panic-app-uninstall-and-repo-reset.html)

Estimated time to wipe down your phone: 10 seconds


Stay prepared for a crackdown on the internet 
==================================================


Disabling internet is the first point of prevention against local
resistance [\[3\]](https://internetshutdowns.in/). Fortunately, some
apps enable people to contact their neighbors without internet. As long
as your neighbors have installed these apps, and are within range, these
apps can form a chain of connectivity just by using bluetooth.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to set-up a mesh network that works across
apps like normal internet does.


Ask your neighbors to have these apps as a backup against internet
crackdown. You do not need to use these apps in normal times.

F-Droid
------------

Local play store without internet. You can share the apps that you have
installed via bluetooth with nearby people.


Firechat 
-------------

Local twitter without internet. You can find people nearby who have
Firechat (range 200ft) and broadcast messages. It makes a chain (or a
mesh) of people who all have Firechat, thus having an alternative
internet without the internet. Do not trust sensitive private messages
with this app, if you have other alternatives.

[Install from play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opengarden.firechat)


Privacy concepts 
=====================

A typical internet communication involves five players that we should be
aware of. While considering privacy, we should be aware of who **knows**
what and who **remembers** what. Let us consider the example of WhatsApp
and you sending a message to your friend. What are the players involved
and what do they know and remember:

#### Privacy with WhatsApp
| **Player**                                      | **Knows**                                                                         | **Remembers**                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Your device (e.g Android phone)                 | Message content                                                                   | Message content.                                                                  |
| Your ISP (e.g. Airtel, Jio, Idea)               | You are using WhatsApp. Size and frequency of communication with whatsapp server. | You are using WhatsApp. Size and frequency of communication with whatsapp server. |
| WhatsApp Server                                 | Message sender and recipient timestamp, size etc.                                 | Message’s sender, its recipient, timestamp, size etc.                             |
| Friend ISP (e.g Airtel, Jio, Idea)              | Friend is using whatsapp. Size and frequency of messages.                         | Friend is using whatsapp. Size and frequency of messages.                         |
| Friends device (e.g. Android phone, laptop etc) | Message content                                                                   | Message content                                                                   |

Why is it helpful? If a government agency wants to target you, then they
would use any and all information that they can find. If in your
location and political scenario, guilt by association is enough, then
just the information that you were talking to someone is enough to put
you in trouble. They do not even need message contents. They just need
to know that your were in touch with that person.

Why use Signal instead of WhatsApp
---------------------------------------

[Download Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)

There is always a tradeoff between convenience and privacy. While
WhatsApp promises to be as secure as Signal, we (me and organizations
like [EFF](https://www.eff.org/)) do not trust it. *WhatsApp is owned by
Facebook*. How much can you trust Facebook with privacy? You see youtube
videos inside WhatsApp? You immediately disclose to both WhatsApp and
Youtube that you are watching that particular video, probably including
your phone number and the sender’s phone number.

Another difference between WhatsApp and Signal is in the “Remembers”
column of row “App server”. Signal promises to forget the time and size
of messages you are sending, while WhatsApp does not. This means the
only way to find out the people you are interacting with is your actual
phone or your friends phone. Here’s the table replicated for Signal.

#### Privacy with Signal (Differences from WhatsApp are in bold)
| **Player**                                                      | **Knows**                                                                       | **Remembers**                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Your device (e.g Android phone)                                 | Message content                                                                 | Message content.  **Forgets if disappearing messages are enabled.**             |
| Your ISP (e.g. Airtel, Jio, Idea)                               | You are using Signal. Size and frequency of communication with whatsapp server. | You are using Signal. Size and frequency of communication with whatsapp server. |

| Friend ISP (e.g Airtel, Jio, Idea)                              | Friend is using whatsapp. Size and frequency of messages.                       | Friend is using whatsapp. Size and frequency of messages.                       |
